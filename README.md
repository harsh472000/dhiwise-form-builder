# Form Builder Application

## Project Overview

This Form Builder application enables users to design and customize forms by dragging and dropping various form controls onto a canvas. Users can arrange controls like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns, set properties, and preview the form in real-time. Additionally, users can view and copy the generated React.js code for the forms they create.
